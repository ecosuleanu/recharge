# Recharge Tech Lab

## Intent

The tech lab is a new part of Recharges' interview process. As a result, we appreciate any feedback regarding this approach and thank you for taking the time to complete one of these!

The intent isn't to trip you up or test your knowledge of arcane algorithms; it's to help us understand how you approach problem solving.

As a result, there are no guaranteed right answers. We believe in Perl's motto that [there's more than one way to do it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_more_than_one_way_to_do_it).

## Labs

1. The docker/python/nginx lab is in the [containerize](containerize) directory and is pulled from [Ad Hoc's set of homework assignments](https://homework.adhoc.team/).
1. The terraform standalone lab is in the [terraform_standalone](terraform_standalone) directory and has been developed by our team.
1. The terraform website lab is in the [terraform_website](terraform_website) directory and has been developed by our team.
    * This will require access to a Google Cloud Project. You can use the [free tier](https://cloud.google.com/free) or let us know and we can setup a temporary project for you.

Note that the terraform standalone lab, while it doesn't require any external resources, is considered more difficult than the terraform website lab.

## Deliverables

* Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file in each lab's directory. All of your work per lab should be done within that directory.
* Your git commits should clearly communicate your intent and choices made while completing the tasks.
* Add notes on running your solution and why you choose your particular solution in a `COMMENTS.md` file in each lab's directory. Remember, you are working with a remote team. Written communication is important!
* Finally, submit all of the above via a Pull Request against the repo. This is what will be referenced during the Tech Lab Review Panel.
